       <!--l. 10--><p class="noindent" >The sharp rise in computing power over the years has given us several new tools for scientific computation.
       Systems such as Magma and Mathematica are used for symbolic computation. SAT (satisfiability)
       and SMT (satisfiability modulo theory) solvers are used for making logical deductions from
       hypotheses.
       <!--l. 16--><p class="noindent" >Many promising uses of computers are also emerging, such as machine learning, proof assistants, and large
       language models (LLMs).
       <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1    </span> <a 
 id="x1-10001"></a>Proof Assistants in Mathematics</h3>
       <!--l. 21--><p class="noindent" >The first machine-generated proof was a proof of the <span 
class="ptmb7t-">four-color theorem</span>. This proof involved reducing a
       graph to one of a few thousand cases, and showing that each of these cases was four-colorable.
       Showing the colourability of each of these cases was tedious, and a computer greatly simplified the
       process.
       <!--l. 28--><p class="noindent" >Proof assistants are programs that verify the correctness of a proof using logical deduction based on
       predefined rules. <span 
class="ptmb7t-">Lean </span>and <span 
class="ptmb7t-">Coq </span>are two widely used proof assistants. They include a library of pre-proved
       lemmas which simplify the creation of new proofs
       <!--l. 34--><p class="noindent" >Proof assistants can be used to explore proofs that are beyond human intuition, existing literature, and
       connections to other ways of thinking. They can be used in tandem with AI to find new proof strategies and
       to automatically generate simple proofs.
       <!--l. 40--><p class="noindent" >
       <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2    </span> <a 
 id="x1-20002"></a>Machine Learning in Mathematics</h3>
       <!--l. 42--><p class="noindent" >Machine learning has been used to discover unintuitive mathematical relations. For example, it was used in
       knot theory to discover the relation between the hyperbolic invariants and the signature of a
       knot.
       <!--l. 46--><p class="noindent" >The authors trained a neural network on a database of two million knots to predict the signature of a knot
       based on its hyperbolic invariants. Then, based on a <span 
class="ptmb7t-">saliency analysis </span>(checking the sensitivity of the
       network to perturbations of a parameter), they determined that the signature depends mostly on three out
       of the three dozen parameters. This allowed them to propose a conjecture that explained the
       relation.
       <!--l. 54--><p class="noindent" >
       <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3    </span> <a 
 id="x1-30003"></a>LLMs in Mathematics</h3>
       <!--l. 56--><p class="noindent" >LLMs show promise in suggesting proof strategies and generating simple proofs. An LLM can be
       connected to traditional tools like WolframAlpha to boost its power to do mathematics. By making an
       LLM produce output in a proof assistant language, we can ensure some level of correctness.
       Conversing with the model can also stimulate mathematical thought indirectly by suggesting proof
       approaches.
       <!--l. 63--><p class="noindent" >Tools such as GitHub Copilot have shown moderate productivity increase when writing code. More
       advanced tools such as Lean Copilot are in development to suggest proofs for short mathematical
       statements, using proof assistants to filter out hallucinations and provide feedback to the AI.
