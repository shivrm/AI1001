       <!--l. 11--><p class="noindent" >The definition of &#8220;intelligence&#8221; varies along two dimensions: human vs. rational and thought vs. behaviour,
       each with different methods. The six main disciplines are natural language processing, knowledge
       representation, automated reasoning, machine learning, computer vision, and robotics.

              <!--l. 17--><p class="noindent" >The <span 
class="ptmb7t-">Turing Test </span>(Alan Turing, 1950) was proposed to test the intelligence of a computer.
              A computer passes the test if a human interrogator cannot tell the computer&#8217;s responses
              from those of a human.

              <!--l. 21--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="ptmb7t-">Cognitive science </span>brings together AI and psychology. We can learn about human thought
              through introspection, brain imaging, and psychological experiments. A sufficiently precise
              theory of the mind allows us to express the theory as a computer program.

              <!--l. 25--><p class="noindent" >The  <span 
class="ptmb7t-">logicist  tradition  </span>of  artificial  intelligence  builds  on  programs  that  can  solve  any
              problem written in logical notation (solvers). The uncertainty of the real world is filled
              using <span 
class="ptmb7t-">probability</span>, allowing rigorous reasoning even with uncertain information.

              <li class="itemize">
              <!--l. 29--><p class="noindent" >Computer agents are programs that percieve their environment and operate autonomously
              for extended periods. A <span 
class="ptmb7t-">rational agent </span>acts to achieve the best expected outcome.</li></ul>
       <!--l. 34--><p class="noindent" >The rational-agent approach is popular due to its generality and flexibility. The <span 
class="ptmb7t-">standard model</span>
       involves agents that &#8220;do the right thing.&#8221;. However, the values given to the machine may not
       match our true values (value alignment problem), and may have negative consequences. For
       example a chess-playing machine with the sole goal of winning might try to kill the opponent.
       We want the agent to be cautious when the objective is unknown, and ultimately, be <span 
class="ptmb7t-">provably</span>
       <span 
class="ptmb7t-">beneficial</span>.
       <!--l. 41--><p class="noindent" >The foundations of artificial intelligence are drawn from a large number of disciplines:
              <ul class="itemize1">
              <li class="itemize">
              <!--l. 43--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="ptmb7t-">Philosophy</span>: <span 
class="ptmb7t-">Aristotle&#8217;s syllogisms </span>for logical reasoning were an attempt to formulate the
              working  of  the  rational  mind.  <span 
class="ptmb7t-">Dualism  </span>held  that  these  was  a  part  of  the  mind  exempt
              from physical laws, and <span 
class="ptmb7t-">materialism </span>held otherwise. The <span 
class="ptmb7t-">principle of induction </span>is used
              to reduce problems, The actions of an agent are governed either by <span 
class="ptmb7t-">utilitarianism </span>(best
              possible outcome) or by <span 
class="ptmb7t-">deontological ethics </span>(agreement with value system).
              </li>
              <li class="itemize">
              <!--l. 50--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="ptmb7t-">Mathematics</span>:   <span 
class="ptmb7t-">Probability   </span>generalizes   logic   to   uncertain   situations.   <span 
class="ptmb7t-">Statistics   </span>and
              <span 
class="ptmb7t-">decision theory </span>provide a framework for making decisions. <span 
class="ptmb7t-">Game theory </span>lets us account
              for the actions of other agents. The notion of <span 
class="ptmb7t-">satisficing </span>- making decisions that are &#8220;good
              enough&#8221;, gives a better description or actual human behaviour.

              <!--l. 56--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="ptmb7t-">Neuroscience</span>:  The  exact  working  of  the  human  brain  is  still  a  great  mystery.  Digital
              computers operate at a clock rate that is a million times faster than a brain but the brain
              makes up for that with storage and interconnection. The development of <span 
class="ptmb7t-">brain-machine</span>
              <span 
class="ptmb7t-">interfaces </span>is promising and may shed light on many aspects of neural systems.
