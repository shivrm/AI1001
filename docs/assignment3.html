<p>The definition of “intelligence” varies along two dimensions: human
vs. rational and thought vs. behaviour, each with different methods. The
six main disciplines are natural language processing, knowledge
representation, automated reasoning, machine learning, computer vision,
and robotics.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <span><strong>Turing Test</strong></span> (Alan Turing, 1950)
was proposed to test the intelligence of a computer. A computer passes
the test if a human interrogator cannot tell the computer’s responses
from those of a human.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Cognitive science</strong></span> brings together
AI and psychology. We can learn about human thought through
introspection, brain imaging, and psychological experiments. A
sufficiently precise theory of the mind allows us to express the theory
as a computer program.</p></li>
<li><p>The <span><strong>logicist tradition</strong></span> of
artificial intelligence builds on programs that can solve any problem
written in logical notation (solvers). The uncertainty of the real world
is filled using <strong>probability</strong>, allowing rigorous
reasoning even with uncertain information.</p></li>
<li><p>Computer agents are programs that percieve their environment and
operate autonomously for extended periods. A <span><strong>rational
agent</strong></span> acts to achieve the best expected
outcome.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The rational-agent approach is popular due to its generality and
flexibility. The <strong>standard model</strong> involves agents that
“do the right thing.”. However, the values given to the machine may not
match our true values (value alignment problem), and may have negative
consequences. For example a chess-playing machine with the sole goal of
winning might try to kill the opponent. We want the agent to be cautious
when the objective is unknown, and ultimately, be <strong>provably
beneficial</strong>.</p>
<p>The foundations of artificial intelligence are drawn from a large
number of disciplines:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span><strong>Philosophy</strong></span>: <strong>Aristotle’s
syllogisms</strong> for logical reasoning were an attempt to formulate
the working of the rational mind. <strong>Dualism</strong> held that
these was a part of the mind exempt from physical laws, and
<strong>materialism</strong> held otherwise. The <strong>principle of
induction</strong> is used to reduce problems, The actions of an agent
are governed either by <strong>utilitarianism</strong> (best possible
outcome) or by <strong>deontological ethics</strong> (agreement with
value system).</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Mathematics</strong></span>:
<strong>Probability</strong> generalizes logic to uncertain situations.
<strong>Statistics</strong> and <strong>decision theory</strong> provide
a framework for making decisions. <strong>Game theory</strong> lets us
account for the actions of other agents. The notion of
<strong>satisficing</strong> - making decisions that are “good enough”,
gives a better description or actual human behaviour.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Neuroscience</strong></span>: The exact working of
the human brain is still a great mystery. Digital computers operate at a
clock rate that is a million times faster than a brain but the brain
makes up for that with storage and interconnection. The development of
<strong>brain-machine interfaces</strong> is promising and may shed
light on many aspects of neural systems.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Psychology</strong></span>: <strong>Cognitive
physchology</strong> views the brain as an information- processing
device. <strong>Behaviourism</strong> looks at the response of systems
to stimulus.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Computer Engineering</strong></span>: Faster
computers allow for speedup in AI algorithms. <strong>Quantum
computing</strong> might offer a large speedup. Specialized hardware
such as GPUs, NPUs and wafer scale engine (WSE) have been developed for
AI applications.</p></li>
<li><p>Artificial intelligence also borrows <strong>regulatory
mechanisms</strong> from <span><strong>control theory</strong></span>,
and developments in <strong>knowledge representation</strong> from
<span><strong>linguistics</strong></span>.</p></li>
</ul>
