<p>The sharp rise in computing power over the years has given us several
new tools for scientific computation. Systems such as Magma and
Mathematica are used for symbolic computation. SAT (satisfiability) and
SMT (satisfiability modulo theory) solvers are used for making logical
deductions from hypotheses.</p>
<p>Many promising uses of computers are also emerging, such as machine
learning, proof assistants, and large language models (LLMs).</p>
<h1 id="proof-assistants-in-mathematics">Proof Assistants in
Mathematics</h1>
<p>The first machine-generated proof was a proof of the
<strong>four-color theorem</strong>. This proof involved reducing a
graph to one of a few thousand cases, and showing that each of these
cases was four-colorable. Showing the colourability of each of these
cases was tedious, and a computer greatly simplified the process.</p>
<p>Proof assistants are programs that verify the correctness of a proof
using logical deduction based on predefined rules. <strong>Lean</strong>
and <strong>Coq</strong> are two widely used proof assistants. They
include a library of pre-proved lemmas which simplify the creation of
new proofs</p>
<p>Proof assistants can be used to explore proofs that are beyond human
intuition, existing literature, and connections to other ways of
thinking. They can be used in tandem with AI to find new proof
strategies and to automatically generate simple proofs.</p>
<h1 id="machine-learning-in-mathematics">Machine Learning in
Mathematics</h1>
<p>Machine learning has been used to discover unintuitive mathematical
relations. For example, it was used in knot theory to discover the
relation between the hyperbolic invariants and the signature of a
knot.</p>
<p>The authors trained a neural network on a database of two million
knots to predict the signature of a knot based on its hyperbolic
invariants. Then, based on a <strong>saliency analysis</strong>
(checking the sensitivity of the network to perturbations of a
parameter), they determined that the signature depends mostly on three
out of the three dozen parameters. This allowed them to propose a
conjecture that explained the relation.</p>
<h1 id="llms-in-mathematics">LLMs in Mathematics</h1>
<p>LLMs show promise in suggesting proof strategies and generating
simple proofs. An LLM can be connected to traditional tools like
WolframAlpha to boost its power to do mathematics. By making an LLM
produce output in a proof assistant language, we can ensure some level
of correctness. Conversing with the model can also stimulate
mathematical thought indirectly by suggesting proof approaches.</p>
<p>Tools such as GitHub Copilot have shown moderate productivity
increase when writing code. More advanced tools such as Lean Copilot are
in development to suggest proofs for short mathematical statements,
using proof assistants to filter out hallucinations and provide feedback
to the AI.</p>
