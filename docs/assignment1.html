<h1 id="ai-boom">AI boom</h1>
<p>The AI boom is an ongoing period of rapid progress in AI. It started
in the late 2010s and was catalyzed by the usage of artificial neural
networks and deep learning. The AI boom has had cultural, economic and
social impact and has led to artificial intelligence becoming a widely
prominent topic of popular discussion. Concerns such as impersonation of
humans, intellectual property rights, energy usage, threats to job
security, biases in training data, and risk of human extinction have
been raised in response to it.</p>
<p>The AI boom has led to the development of programs such as AlexNet
(image recognition), AlphaZero (playing board games) and AlphaFold
(protein folding), as well as generative models for text, image and
music generation. These programs involve techniques such as generative
adversarial networks (GANs), diffusion models and transformer
architectures. Established companies such as Apple, Amazon, Google and
Microsoft have dominated the market using their vast resources of cloud
infrastructure, AI chips and computing power. Companies such as Nvidia
who manufacture GPUs for AI training and usage have seen a huge growth
in market cap.</p>
<h1 id="ai-effect">AI effect</h1>
<p>The AI effect a phenomenon where the tasks that an AI program can
perform successfully re no longer considered as AI, but simply as
automations. The notion of “intelligence” is redefined to exclude
whatever has been performed successfully. The term was coined by John
McCarthy, who put it simply as "As soon as it works, no one calls it AI
anymore." Michael Kearns suggests that people subconsciously feel the
need to be special and by discounting artificial intelligence, they can
continue to feel unique and special.</p>
<p>The AI effect happens in diverse fields such as agriculture,
hospitality, and marketing, and computer chess and leads to AI and AI
researchers being underappreciated. This led to AI researches in the
1990s avoiding the term “artificial intelligence.” The effect can be
mitigated by underselling AI and making it less conspicuous. According
to the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, the AI effect is a worldwide
strategic threat, and the failure to recognise AI can undermine the
recognition of security threats.</p>
