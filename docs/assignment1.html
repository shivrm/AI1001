       <!--l. 12--><p class="noindent" >The AI boom is an ongoing period of rapid progress in AI. It started in the late 2010s and was catalyzed by
       the usage of artificial neural networks and deep learning. The AI boom has had cultural, economic and
       social impact and has led to artificial intelligence becoming a widely prominent topic of popular discussion.
       Concerns such as impersonation of humans, intellectual property rights, energy usage, threats to job
       security, biases in training data, and risk of human extinction have been raised in response to
       it.
       <!--l. 19--><p class="noindent" >The AI boom has led to the development of programs such as AlexNet (image recognition), AlphaZero
       (playing board games) and AlphaFold (protein folding), as well as generative models for text, image and
       music generation. These programs involve techniques such as generative adversarial networks (GANs),
       diffusion models and transformer architectures. Established companies such as Apple, Amazon, Google and
       Microsoft have dominated the market using their vast resources of cloud infrastructure, AI chips and
       computing power. Companies such as Nvidia who manufacture GPUs for AI training and usage have seen a
       huge growth in market cap.

 id="x1-20002"></a>AI effect</h3>
       <!--l. 30--><p class="noindent" >The AI effect a phenomenon where the tasks that an AI program can perform successfully re no longer
       considered as AI, but simply as automations. The notion of &#8220;intelligence&#8221; is redefined to exclude whatever
       has been performed successfully. The term was coined by John McCarthy, who put it simply as &#8221;As soon as
       it works, no one calls it AI anymore.&#8221; Michael Kearns suggests that people subconsciously feel the need
       to be special and by discounting artificial intelligence, they can continue to feel unique and
       special.
       <!--l. 37--><p class="noindent" >The AI effect happens in diverse fields such as agriculture, hospitality, and marketing, and computer chess
       and leads to AI and AI researchers being underappreciated. This led to AI researches in the 1990s
       avoiding the term &#8220;artificial intelligence.&#8221; The effect can be mitigated by underselling AI and
       making it less conspicuous. According to the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, the AI effect is a
       worldwide strategic threat, and the failure to recognise AI can undermine the recognition of security
       threats.
